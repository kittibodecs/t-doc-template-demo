---

This chapter covers everything you need to know in advance â€” be aware of the Prerequisites (as few as there are), have a bird view perspective of the content of this template docs, and understand how to use it efficiently so that you have your website running as soon as possible. 
Finally, you get to know how to ask for support if you'd need it, and how to contribute to Toucan and its templates if you'd like to.
