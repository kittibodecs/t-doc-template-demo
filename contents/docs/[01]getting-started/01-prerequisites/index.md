# Prerequisites


## Before you start

This template requires Toucan Static Site Generator (SSG).

Make sure you have it installed and set up according to its official [documentation](https://toucansites.com/docs/).
Once the SSG is ready, you can come back here and continue with the template setup and customization.

> **Note** 
During the beta release, Toucan is available only for macOS and Linux. Windows support will be coming soon.
If you’d like to help improve Toucan on Windows, consider submitting a PR to the project’s repository on GitHub.
