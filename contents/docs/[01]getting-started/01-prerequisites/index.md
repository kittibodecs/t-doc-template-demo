# Prerequisites


## Before you start

This template requires **Toucan Static Site Generator (SSG)**.

Make sure you have it installed and set up according to its official [Toucan documentation](https://toucansites.com/docs/).
Once the SSG is ready, you can come back here and continue with the template setup and customization.

> **Note** 
Toucan is available only for macOS and Linux. Windows support will be coming soon.
If you’d like to help improve Toucan on Windows, consider submitting a PR to the project’s repository on GitHub. 

## Where to start?

If you already have Toucan up and running, just use this guide to apply any customization your project needs. 

You can get started by forking [T-Doc template demo repository](https://github.com/toucansites/t-doc-template-demo)

If you still hesitate whether Toucan matches your needs or not, drop us an e-mail to support@binarybirds.com or get to know it reading [Toucan documentation](https://toucansites.com/docs/).
