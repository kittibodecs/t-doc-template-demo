# How to use

---

The T-Doc template is powered by our Toucan static site generator, which combines Markdown for content creation with Mustache templates for layout and design. Markdown lets you write clean, formatted text in plain-text files that Toucan automatically converts into HTML, while Mustache provides an elegant way to customize layouts and even build dynamic components. Together, these tools give you full control over both the content and the appearance of your site, making it easy to add, edit, and manage pages while keeping the design professional and visually appealing.

Customization is simple and flexible—you can change any part of the site independently, without being tied to other components.

No matter what you update—whether it’s a logo, a new custom page, or color—you’ll always follow the same simple workflow: regenerate the site and verify the result in your browser. The documentation is organized into optional, standalone guides, so you can either read step by step or jump directly to the parts you need; each article makes sense on its own.
